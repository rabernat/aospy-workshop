The workshop will be held on
`Columbia's Morningside Campus <http://www.columbia.edu/content/morningside-heights.html>`_
in 603 `Schermerhorn Hall <http://library.columbia.edu/locations/geology/directions.html/>`_.
If traveling by subway, take the 1 line to 116th street. The map below shows
how to walk to Schermerhorn from the subway stop.
From College Walk (the pedestrian boulevard corresponding to W. 116th Street
between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue), go up the right (east) side steps of
Low Plaza, which is the large open space in front of the domed Low Library
Building. Continue on the walkway that runs along the east side of the Low
Library Building. Make a right as you reach the cafe terrace of Uris Hall.
The red-brick, tall-windowed Schermerhorn Hall will then be on the left.
Room 603 is right next to the
`Geology Library <http://library.columbia.edu/locations/geology/directions.html>`_.
Inside Schermerhorn, take the elevator or stairs to the sixth floor.


The building *should* be unlocked on Saturday by 9am (the workshop start time).
Arriving earlier than 9 is recommended, especially for early presenters.
We will try to prop the door open, but if you have any problems getting in,
call or text Ryan (+1-617-800-4237).
